## Description
This is an application that is designed to make every day task easier for the person on the go. It is designed with a simple user interface and easy to use features. The goal is less is more. This application is a reminder app that features location based reminders based on proximity. The application will take user inputs into a to-do list type interface. The user will input a reminder i.e pick up oranges then will input under location the store that they wish to go i.e Walmart. The application will then pull search results from google maps of the nearest Walmarts and pormpt the user to pick the desired one. After the location of the to-do list item is selected, the user will be prompted to choose the proximity of which they wish to be alerted. The application will request access to user gps and track location til the to-do list item has expired or has been completed by user.

As a person who is always on the go and with an endless amount of errands to run. 
I need an application that will help me complete these items.  I would like to be alerted within a proximity of my desire and I would like alerts to be sent to my phones homescreen. I also would like to choose the location of  where I would like to complete my item and the choice to put an expiration date on the item.
I am also not tech savvy and need a simple interface I can navigate.

The user will be able to create new To-do list are desired. The user will be able to link each item to a location. 
The user will have the flexibility to set radius of alerts and an expiration date on items in their to do list.
